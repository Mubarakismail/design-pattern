/*
 * Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.
 *
 * The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and
 * transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.
 *
 */

/*
 * The Adapter pattern allows you to use 3rd-party or legacy classes even if theyâ€™re incompatible with the bulk of your code.
 *  For example, instead of rewriting the notification interface of your app to support each 3rd-party service such as Slack,
 *  Facebook, SMS or (you-name-it), you can create a set of special wrappers that adapt calls from your app to an interface
 *  and format required by each 3rd-party class.
