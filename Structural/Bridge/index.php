/*
 *
 * Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that
 *  can be developed independently.
 *
 * One of these hierarchies (often called the Abstraction) will get a reference to an object of the second hierarchy (Implementation).
 * The abstraction will be able to delegate some (sometimes, most) of its calls to the implementations object. Since all implementations
 *  will have a common interface, theyâ€™d be interchangeable inside the abstraction.
