/*
 *
 * Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex
 * data structure without exposing its internal details.
 *
 *
 * Thanks to the Iterator, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar
 * fashion using a single iterator interface.
 *
 *
 * Since PHP already has a built-in Iterator interface, which provides convenient integration with
 *  foreach loops, itâ€™s very easy to create your own iterators for traversing almost every imaginable
 *  data structure.
 *
 * This example of the Iterator pattern provides easy access to CSV files.
