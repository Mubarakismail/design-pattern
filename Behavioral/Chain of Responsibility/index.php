/*
 *
 * Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern that allows passing request along
 * the chain of potential handlers until one of them handles request.
 *
 * The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling sender
 * class to the concrete classes of the receivers. The chain can be composed dynamically
 *  at runtime with any handler that follows a standard handler interface.
 */


/**
 * The most widely known use of the Chain of Responsibility (CoR) pattern in the PHP world is found in HTTP request middleware.
 * These are implemented by the most popular PHP frameworks and even got standardized as part of PSR-15.
 *
 * It works like this: an HTTP request must pass through a stack of middleware objects in order to be handled by the app.
 * Each middleware can either reject the further processing of the request or pass it to the next middleware.
 * Once the request successfully passes all middleware, the primary handler of the app can finally handle it.
 *
 * You might have noticed that this approach is kind of inverse to the original intent of the pattern. Indeed,
 * in the typical implementation, a request is only passed along a chain if a current handler Canâ€™t process it,
 * while a middleware passes the request further down the chain when it thinks that the app CAN handle the request. Nevertheless,
 * since middleware objects are chained, the whole concept is still considered an example of the CoR pattern.
