/*
 *
 * The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a standalone object, allowing you to:
 * Parameterize methods with different requests,
 * Queue, log, or undo operations,
 * And decouple the object that sends the request from the one that handles it.
 *
 *
 * A remote control (invoker) sends a signal to a TV, a speaker, or an AC unit (receiver).
 * Each button is wired to a command (turn on/off), but the remote doesnâ€™t know what the
 * device is doing internally.
